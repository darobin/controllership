        In modern web development it is common for third parties to be involved at all levels, from
        the CDN to distinct web and database hosting to libraries, APIs, services, and trackers for
        analytics, marketing, or advertising.

        These third parties are not all equal, however. From a data protection perspective, some are
        merely service providers for the first party and whatever personal data they may have access
        to remains under the control of the party which which the user has a direct relationship;
        while others are third-party data controllers and have the right to independent secondary
        reuse of the data they obtain. This distinction is particularly important to rendering
        privacy-related decision but is unfortunately absent as a primitive of the platform.
